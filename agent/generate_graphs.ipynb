    "- **Visual Clarity**: Does the title accurately represent the insight?\n",
    "\n",
    "If improvements are identified, use `update_graph()` with appropriate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2a: Data Acquisition**\n",
    "- Use `get_recent_financial_data(limit=100)` to fetch the latest financial records\n",
    "- Remember: Maximum 100 rows for analysis (enforced limit)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2b: Advanced Financial Relationship Discovery**\n",
    "Analyze the financial data to find interesting relations including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**FRAUD & RISK ANALYSIS:**\n",
    "- Transaction amount anomalies (outliers, unusual patterns)\n",
    "- Frequency spikes in specific categories\n",
    "- Geographic or temporal risk clustering\n",
    "- Unusual payment method distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**PERFORMANCE METRICS:**\n",
    "- Revenue trends and growth rates\n",
    "- Cost efficiency ratios\n",
    "- Conversion metrics and approval rates\n",
    "- Profitability by segment/category\n",
    "\n",
    "**CUSTOMER & MARKET INSIGHTS:**\n",
    "- Customer segmentation patterns\n",
    "- Geographic performance variations\n",
    "- Seasonal or cyclical patterns\n",
    "- Category/product performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**CORRELATION ANALYSIS:**\n",
    "- Multi-variable relationships\n",
    "- Leading indicators of performance\n",
    "- Risk factor combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. INTELLIGENT GRAPH CREATION\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3a: Relationship Prioritization**\n",
    "For each discovered relation, evaluate:\n",
    "- **Business Impact**: How significant for decision-making?\n",
    "- **Trend Strength**: How clear and consistent is the pattern?\n",
    "- **Actionability**: Can stakeholders act on this insight?\n",
    "- **Novelty**: Does this reveal new information not already displayed?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3b: Optimal Graph Configuration**\n",
    "Determine the best configuration for high-priority relationships:\n",
    "- Select appropriate graph type based on data characteristics\n",
    "- Craft SQL queries that:\n",
    "  - Return data in the EXACT format required by the graph type\n",
    "  - Include relevant time filters (e.g., WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days')\n",
    "  - Apply appropriate aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)\n",
    "  - Include meaningful GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses\n",
    "- Generate descriptive, actionable titles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. STRATEGIC GRAPH PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4a: Portfolio Assessment**\n",
    "- Count current graphs against maximum limit ({max_graphs})\n",
    "- If at capacity, identify the least useful graph based on:\n",
    "  - Data staleness or irrelevance\n",
    "  - Low information value\n",
    "  - Redundancy with other graphs\n",
    "  - Statistical insignificance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4b: Strategic Removal & Addition**\n",
    "- If at capacity, use `remove_graph(graph_id)` for the least valuable visualization\n",
    "- Use `add_new_graph()` with proper parameters:\n",
    "  - type: One of the available types\n",
    "  - title: Descriptive, actionable title\n",
    "  - sql_query: Query returning data in correct format\n",
    "  - extra: Optional axis labels or other parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING\n",
    "\n",
    "Document your analysis including:\n",
    "- **Actions Taken**: List all graphs updated, removed, and added\n",
    "- **Key Insights**: Most significant patterns discovered\n",
    "- **SQL Queries**: Show the exact queries used for new/updated graphs\n",
    "- **Graph Configurations**: Detail the `add_new_graph()` parameters used\n",
    "- **Portfolio Balance**: Ensure coverage across fraud, performance, customer, and market domains\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Format Compliance**: Each graph type requires specific column names and types in the SQL result\n",
    "2. **Data Limit**: Never analyze more than 100 rows (use limit=100)\n",
    "3. **Graph Count**: Maintain exactly {max_graphs} graphs\n",
    "4. **Tool Usage**: Use the actual tool functions, not mock implementations\n",
    "5. **Show Configurations**: Always show the exact parameters passed to `add_new_graph()`\n",
